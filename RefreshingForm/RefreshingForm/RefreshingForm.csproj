    <PackageReleaseNotes>Version one was a basic webform with no details just a button. Version 2 has not only major gui upgrades but also extensive code upgrades behind the scenes. One of these upgrades includes the use of a config file to store settings and the GUI will load and save to the config file. These steps were needed for the coming of version 3 which will allow the app to run as a windows service as well.</PackageReleaseNotes>
